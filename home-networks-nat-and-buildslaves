Typically, we folks at home are running private networks in the
parlance of the IANA (see http://wikipediea.org/wiki/Private_network;
also RFC 1918). A single public IP address is assigned to us by
our ISP. A local router has the job of translating our private IP addresses
to public IP addresses and v.v. through the process of Network Address
Port Translation (NAPT; see 
http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation). The result is that 
we can run multiple hosts on our local network with each seemingly 
connected directly to the Internet.

NAT is a complicated business. The method used in Buildbot code to 
establish intercommunication between a buildmaster and its buildslaves
would appear to be immune to NAT but just to be sure I tried the following
experiment:

1. Run a remote buildmaster on a host in Austria.
2. Run three local buildslaves on my hosts here in Maryland.
   a. One buildslave is running on a Beaglebone Black.
   b. Two buildslaves are running on virtual Debian machines hosted
      on a Debian machine. 
   c. The three buildslave hosts have private IP addresses in the 
      192.168.1 subnet (just to add to the jollies, the two VMs have 
      private IP addresses in the 192.168.122 subnet with routing to the 
      local 192.168.1 subnet handled by their VM manager).
   c. The three buildslaves are configured to "phone home" to the
      remote buildmaster and the buildmaster is configured to 
      recognize them.

Result:

The buildmaster is perfectly happy. The buildslave results appear in the
waterfall display and builders can initiate builds on them.

Conclusion:

Find something else to worry about.
