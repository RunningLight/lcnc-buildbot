Initial thoughts

1. Generalize to building different branches.
   - could define separate builders
   - could use existing builders modified to
     employ the property parameter
   - either way, one should figure out a way to
     display the results for different branches
     in some organized way, preferably each to
     its own waterfall page.
   - in extremus, just run separate buildmasters

2. Add a LCNC documentation builder
   - a fly-in-the-ointment is the current inability
     of the LCNC make process to create docs in 
     recent distros. It seems to be an incompatibility
     among asciidoc, tex, and various style files.
     Until the problem is fixed,
     one would have to create a buildslave on an
     older distro such as Ubuntu/Lucid 10.04lts 
     for the purpose of building documentation

3. Add package builders

4. Specialize and prettify the Web-page reports 
   for LCNC builds.

5. Map the Web-page reports into an existing web server 
   instead of using its cut-down server listening to a 
   special port.
