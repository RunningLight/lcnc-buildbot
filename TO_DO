1. Generalize to building different branches.
   - could define separate builders
   - could use existing builders modified to
     employ property, branch, and/or 
     project parameters as needed
   - either way, one should figure out a way to
     display the results for different branches
     in some organized way, preferably each to
     its own waterfall page. NOTE- now that I know
     how to run behind a reverse proxy this becomes
     easy, just use, e.g.,  categories and/on branches
     in the links from the home page to display 
     just the portions of the waterfall desired.
   - in extremus, just run separate buildmasters

2. Add a LCNC documentation builder
   - a fly-in-the-ointment is the current inability
     of the LCNC make process to create docs in 
     recent distros. It seems to be an incompatibility
     among asciidoc, tex, and various style files.
     Until the problem is fixed, one would have to 
     create a buildslave on an older distro such as 
     Ubuntu/Lucid 10.04lts for the purpose of building
     documentation
   - it probably makes sense to add this buildslave to
     a separate builder and scheduler triggered only by 
     changes in the ./docs directory

3. Add package builders

4. Specialize and prettify the Web-page reports 
   for LCNC builds.

5. [DONE - will post configuration files RSN]
   Map the Web-page reports into an existing web server 
   instead of using its cut-down server listening to a 
   special port.
 - on further thought, this probably should be
   done using reverse proxy on the site's existing, 
   outward-facing http server. Port 8010 can then be 
   closed on the firewall.
